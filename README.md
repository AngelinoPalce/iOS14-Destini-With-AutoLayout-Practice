# iOS14-Destini-With-AutoLayout-Practice
Destini App with AutoLayout Challenge - iOS App Design Pattern Challenge - I am one of the students of the App Brewery in the course, "iOS 13 &amp; Swift 5 - The Complete iOS App Development Bootcamp". This project is part of the exercises of the bootcamp. I chose the exercise that has no AutoLayout so that I can practice setting my own AutoLayout.
